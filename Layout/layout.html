      When controlling the flow of text, using the CSS property <span class="inline">display: inline</span> will cause the
      text inside the element to wrap normally.
    </p> -->
    <!-- Behaves Like Inline -->
    <!-- <p>
      While using the property <span class="inline-block">display: inline-block</span> will wrap the element to prevent the
      text inside from extending beyond its parent.
    </p> -->
    <!-- Here it behaves like inline but accepts block properties too -->
    <!-- <p>
      Lastly, using the property <span class="block">display: block</span> will put the element on its own line and fill its
      parent.
    </p> -->
    <!-- Here it behaves like an block level element that is tke full width  -->

      <p>Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies</p>

      Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.
       <br/>
       <br/>
      Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior.
